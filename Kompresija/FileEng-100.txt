 The body, with its various parts, needs to function like a well-rehearsed orchestra. Every system must play its role
properly, and at exactly the right time, or noise and chaos ensue. It is
for this reason that routine is so necessary. The acts of life we repeat
every day need to be automatized. They must be turned into stable
and reliable habits, so they lose their complexity and gain predictability and simplicity. This can be perceived most clearly in the case of
small children, who are delightful and comical and playful when their
sleeping and eating schedules are stable, and horrible and whiny and
nasty when they are not.
It is for such reasons that I always ask my clinical clients first about
sleep. Do they wake up in the morning at approximately the time the
typical person wakes up, and at the same time every day? If the answer
is no, fixing that is the first thing I recommend. It matter 
much if they go to bed at the same time each evening, but waking up
at a consistent hour is a necessity.
